            <h4>Preparation</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Start with the biscuit:</strong>
                Put all the ingredients in the processor and mix very well and put the mixture in a mold, and bake in the
                microwave at 600W for about 2 minutes.
                <br><strong>For the Cheesecake:</strong>
                We start by first processing the banana with the eggs and the erythritol so that it is well spent.
                Once ready, add the rest of the ingredients and process until a smooth cream is left.
                Pour the mixture into the mold on top of the cake that we have baked before and put it to bake in the oven
                preheated to 180ÂºC for 40 minutes.
                Once this time has passed, the center will be slightly shaky, it is as it should be.
                Let the cheesecake cool for 15 min in the oven already off.
                Remove from the oven and let it cool completely before putting it in the fridge to cool completely. Let it
                rest in the refrigerator from one day to the next,
                it is the richest it is or at least 6 hours.
